## Credits

### Content
Support was provided by my fellow student & friend [Mats](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten) by aiding me in bouncing off ideas & venting frustrations. They also provided immeasurable support when my brain was too tired to think straight, & helped me to work through my issues with a second set of eyes. I cannot thank them enough for being there for me.

Also a huge thank you to my mentor, Martina T. who kept me calm when I was on the verge of panic. As well as taught me how to break my thinking down into bite-sized chunks that were easier to manage, instead of trying to figure it all out in one go.

The start of the project is based on the 'Love Sandwiches' walk through, and the functions to obtain the column data & generate an average have been used in this project.
